For Computer Monitor, can you see from the figure that the answer is Yes if you can see and No if you can't
The question seems to be inquiring whether the provided figure can be used as a computer monitor. Based on the content of the image, it is not appropriate or possible to use this image as a functional computer monitor. A computer monitor typically displays graphical user interfaces and applications, which are not present in this image. Instead, the image shows an airplane refrigerator with items inside, indicating that its purpose is for storing food and beverages during a flight rather than serving as a display device for computer-related tasks. Therefore, the answer to the question would be "No" if you cannot see any graphical user interface or applications that would indicate its use as a computer monitor.
