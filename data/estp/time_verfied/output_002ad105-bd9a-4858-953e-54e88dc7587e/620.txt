For the relevant items in question "I need to check my emails. Where should I go? " and answer "The computer monitor displaying an email interface is located on the desk in the office area. Move to the desk to access your emails.", can you see from the figure that the answer is Yes if you can see and No if you can't
The answer to the question "I need to check my emails. Where should I go?" is 'Yes' if you can see from the figure that it's possible to move towards a computer monitor displaying an email interface, which would be located on the desk in the office area. In this scenario, while the video does not show a computer or its screen directly, the context suggests that there could be a workspace nearby where one might typically find such equipment. The setting depicted appears to be a kitchen rather than an office, but given the nature of the task (checking emails), the proximity to a potential work area is reasonable. Therefore, based on the information available in the image and assuming typical room layouts, it's plausible that moving to another part of the house with a computer setup could allow for checking emails.
