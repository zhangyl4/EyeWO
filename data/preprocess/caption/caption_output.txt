**Output Format(JSON)**:

```json
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "name": "object_1",
      "state_changes": "State change description of object_1",
      "positional_changes": "Positional change description of object_1",
      "description": "Object_1 description",
      "relevance_to_action": "Related to action / Not related to action"
    },
    {
      "name": "object_2",
      "state_changes": "State change description of object_2",
      "positional_changes": "Positional change description of object_2",
      "description": "Object_2 description",
      "relevance_to_action": "Related to action / Not related to action"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Key Points**:

1. **Identify both action-relevant objects and background objects**.
2. Ensure that all objects have a **state change**, **positional change**, and **description**.
3. If the object is not involved in the action, mark it as `"Not related to action"`.
4. The output should follow the **exact JSON structure** with each object having the required fields (`name`, `state_changes`, `positional_changes`, `description`, `relevance_to_action`).
