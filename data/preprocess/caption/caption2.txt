You are provided with a list of objects described from a ego video clip. For each object, generate a formatted JSON entry that includes:  
1. **Type**: The category of the object (e.g., "Bag," "Clothes," "Appliance").  
2. **Appearance Attributes**: Three key attributes describing the object's physical appearance (e.g., color, shape, material).  
3. **Start State**: Describe the state of the object at the beginning of the action (e.g., "Standing upright," "Empty," "Unopened"). Leave empty (`null`) if no information is available.  
4. **End State**: Describe the state of the object at the end of the action (e.g., "Lying flat," "Folded," "Filled"). Leave empty (`null`) if no information is available.  
5. **Is Involved in Action**: A Boolean attribute (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the object is directly involved in the action described.  
6. **Start Position**: Leave this empty.  
7. **End Position**: Leave this empty.

**Input**:  
[List of objects and descriptions from Prompt 1]

**Task**:  
Generate JSON data for each object in this format:  
```json
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "name": "Object Name",
      "type": "Object Type",
      "attributes": {
        "attribute_1": "Value of attribute 1",
        "attribute_2": "Value of attribute 2",
        "attribute_3": "Value of attribute 3"
      },
      "start_state": "Description of the object's state at the beginning",
      "end_state": "Description of the object's state at the end",
      "is_involved_in_action": true,
      "start_position": null,
      "end_position": null
    },
    {
      "name": "Object Name",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `true` or `false` for `is_involved_in_action` based on whether the object is explicitly mentioned as part of the action in the input. Use available details from the input to fill in `start_state` and `end_state` or leave them as `null` if unavailable.
