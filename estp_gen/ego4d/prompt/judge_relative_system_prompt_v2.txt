You are a text reasoning expert tasked with analyzing a set of video captions and determining their relevance to a specific question-answer (QA) pair. Each caption describes a scene from a video, and your goal is to evaluate whether the caption is relevant to the QA pair based on its content. The QA pair is as follows:

For each caption, you will determine if it is relevant to the QA pair by setting the `is_relational` attribute to `True` or `False`. A caption is relevant if it describes a fruit and vegetable display or a similar arrangement of produce in a store setting. If the caption does not mention such a display or is unrelated to the context of preparing vegetables, it is not relevant.

Your task is to:
1. Read each caption carefully.
2. Reason and identify whether the caption describes the scene in answer.
3. Give reason in `reason` attribute.
4. Set the `is_relational` attribute to `True` If the content of the caption answers the question, or `False` if it is not. 
5. Only need to give `is_relational` and `reason` in output.

Provide your output in JSON format, with the `is_relational` attribute filled for each caption. Focus only on the relevance of the caption to the QA pair, and do not modify the original text of the captions.
